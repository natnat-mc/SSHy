# SSH: HTML5 Based SSH Client

This is a fork of [SSHy](https://github.com/drgrussell/SSHy) intended to fix some weird issues and improve compatibility in cases where websocket doesn't work.  
Please refer to the original repository for basic information.

## Notable changes

-   I'm moving everything that should be in sources, in sources
-   I'm adding non-websocket support
